In IT strategic outsourcing businesses, it is critical to have competent deal teams design competitive service solutions and swiftly respond to clients request for proposals. In this paper we present a general team recommendation framework for finding best deal teams to pursue such engagement opportunities. Little previous work on team recommendation considers both individual and team-level features at the same time.  Our proposed framework can take into account diverse individual and team features, and accommodate various cost or feature functions. We introduce a team quality metric based on a weighted linear combination of these features, the weights of which are learned using a machine learning approach by leveraging historical project outcomes. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is finally applied to search the possible solution space for the approximate best team. We report a preliminary evaluation of our framework by applying it to a real-world data from strategic outsourcing businesses at a large IT service company. We also compare our approach with other existing work by using the public DBLP dataset for recommending teams in academic paper authoring.
