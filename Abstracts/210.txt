Horizon line is a promising visual cue which can be exploited for robot localization or visual geo-localization. Prominent approaches to horizon line detection rely on edge detection as a pre-processing step which is inherently a non-stable approach due to parameter choices and underlying assumptions. We present a novel horizon line detection approach which uses machine learning and Dynamic Programming (DP) to extract the horizon line from a classification map instead of an edge map. The key idea is assigning a classification score to each pixel, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of the pixel belonging to the horizon line, and representing the classification map as a multi-stage graph. Using DP, the horizon line can be extracted by finding the path that maximizes the sum of classification scores. In contrast to edge maps which are typically binary (edge vs no-edge) and contain gaps, classification maps are continuous and contain no gaps, yielding significantly better solutions. Using classification maps instead of edge maps allows for removing certain assumptions such as the horizon is close to the top of the image or that the horizon forms a straight line. The purpose of these assumptions is to bias the DP solution but they fail to produce good results when they are not valid. We demonstrate our approach on three different data sets and provide comparisons with a traditional approach based on edge maps. Although our training set is comprised of a very small number of images from the same location, our results illustrate that our method generalizes well to images acquired under different conditions and geographical locations.
