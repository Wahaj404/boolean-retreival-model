This paper proposes a method for transferring the RGB color spectrum to near-infrared (NIR) images using deep multi-scale convolutional neural networks. A direct and integrated transfer between NIR and RGB pixels is trained. The trained model does not require any user guidance or a reference image database in the recall phase to produce images with a natural appearance. To preserve the rich details of the NIR image, its high frequency features are transferred to the estimated RGB image. The presented approach is trained and evaluated on a real-world dataset containing a large amount of road scene images in summer. The dataset was captured by a multi-CCD NIR/RGB camera, which ensures a perfect pixel to pixel registration.
