Planning of safe trajectories with interventions in both lateral and longitudinal dynamics of vehicles has huge potential for increasing the road traffic safety. Main challenges for the development of such algorithms are the consideration of vehicle nonholonomic constraints and the efficiency in terms of implementation, so that algorithms run in real time in a vehicle. The recently introduced Augmented CL-RRT algorithm is an approach that uses analytical models for trajectory planning based on the brute force evaluation of many longitudinal acceleration profiles to find collision-free trajectories. The algorithm considers nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle in complex road traffic scenarios with multiple static and dynamic objects, but it requires a lot of computation time. This work proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting suitable acceleration profiles in critical traffic scenarios, so that only few acceleration profiles are used with the Augmented CL-RRT to find a safe trajectory while reducing the computation time. This is realized using a convolutional neural network variant, introduced as 3D-ConvNet, which learns spatiotemporal features from a sequence of predicted occupancy grids generated from predictions of other road traffic participants. These learned features together with hand-designed features of the EGO vehicle are used to predict acceleration profiles. Simulations are performed to compare the brute force approach with the proposed approach in terms of efficiency and safety. The results show vast improvement in terms of efficiency without harming safety. Additionally, an extension to the Augmented CL-RRT algorithm is introduced for finding a trajectory with low severity of injury, if a collision is already unavoidable.
