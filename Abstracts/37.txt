The problem of predicting outcome of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is of great importance in critical care medicine, and has wide implications for quality control in ICUs. A dominant approach to this problem has been to use an ICU score system such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) system, to compute a certain severity score for a patient from a set of clinical observations, and apply a logistic regression model on this score to obtain an estimate of the probability of mortality for the patient, owing to their simplicity, these methods are widely used by clinicians. However, existing ICU score systems, which are built from a fixed set of patient data, often perform poorly when applied to a patient population with different characteristics, also, with changes in patient characteristics, a score system built from a given patient data set becomes suboptimal over time. Moreover, most of these score systems are built using semi-automated procedures, making it difficult to adapt them to a new patient population. Thus there is a huge need for adaptive methods that can automatically learn predictive models from a given set of patient data. Indeed, there has been much work in recent years on applying various machine learning methods to this problem, however these methods learn different representations from the score systems preferred by clinicians. In this work, we develop a machine learning method based on orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learns a score system type model, which enjoys the benefits of both worlds: like other machine learning methods, it is adaptive, like standard score systems, it uses a representation that is easy for clinicians to understand. Experiments on real-world patient data sets show that our method outperforms standard ICU score systems, and performs at least as well as other machine learning methods for this problem.
