Wheezing is common among children and ~50% of those under 6 years of age are thought to experience at least one episode of wheeze. However, due to the heterogeneity of symptoms there are difficulties in treating and diagnosing these children. `Phenotype specific therapy' is one possible avenue of treatment, whereby we use significant pathology and physiology to identify and treat pre-schoolers with wheeze. By performing feature selection algorithms and predictive modelling techniques, this study will attempt to determine if it is possible to robustly distinguish patient diagnostic categories among pre-school children. Univariate feature analysis identified more objective variables and recursive feature elimination a larger number of subjective variables as important in distinguishing between patient categories. Predicative modelling saw a drop in performance when subjective variables were removed from analysis, indicating that these variables are important in distinguishing wheeze classes. We achieved 90%+ performance in AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and 80%+ in kappa statistic, in distinguishing ill from healthy patients. Developed in a synergistic statistical - machine learning approach, our methodologies propose also a novel ROC Cross Evaluation method for model post-processing and evaluation. Our predictive modelling's stability was assessed in computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations.
