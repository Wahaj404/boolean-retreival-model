In this paper an algorithm for the efficient computation of a rejection threshold for Bayes classification is discussed. A theoretical and a practical evaluation of the performance regarding the accuracy of the numerical computation for uni- and multimodal high-dimensional probability distributions is given. Additionally some observations regarding the dimensionality and the number of samples are shared.
