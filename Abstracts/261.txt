In many fields, superior gains have been obtained by leveraging the computational power of machine learning techniques to solve expert tasks. In this paper we present an application of machine learning to agriculture, solving a particular problem of diagnosis of crop disease based on plant images taken with a smartphone. Two pieces of information are important here, the disease incidence and disease severity. We present a classification system that trains a 5 class classification system to determine the state of disease of a plant. The 5 classes represent a health class and 4 disease classes. We further extend the classification system to classify different severity levels for any of the 4 diseases. Severity levels are assigned classes 1 - 5, 1 being a healthy plant, 5 being a severely diseased plant. We present ways of extracting different features from leaf images and show how different extraction methods result in different performance of the classifier. We finally present the smartphone-based system that uses the classification model learnt to do real-time prediction of the state of health of a farmers garden. This works by the farmer uploading an image of a plant in his garden and obtaining a disease score from a remote server.
