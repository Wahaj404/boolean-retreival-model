Over-dispersed network data mining has emerged as a central theme in data science, evident by a sharp increase in the volume of real-world network data with imbalanced clusters. While most of existing clustering methods are designed for discovering the number of clusters and class specific connectivity patterns, few methods are available to uncover the imbalanced clusters, commonly existing in network communities and image segments, from network data with over-dispersed cluster size distribution. The latter is considered as an intrinsic structural property of the network data. In this paper, we propose a generalized probabilistic modeling framework, SizeConnectivity, to estimate over-dispersed cluster size distribution together with class specific connectivity patterns from network data. A wide range of cluster size distributions revealed by real-world network data can be accurately captured by our method. We performed extensive synthetic and real-world experiments on clustering social network data and image data for detecting network communities and image segments. Our results demonstrate a superior performance of our SizeConnectivity clustering method in recovering the hidden structure of network data via modeling over-dispersion.
