Sequential or online dimensional reduction is of interests due to the explosion of streaming data based applications and the requirement of adaptive statistical modeling, in many emerging fields, such as the modeling of energy end-use profile. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a generalized PCA framework. If the random variables under dimensional reduction follow Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the batch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex optimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed compared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance in reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its application in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.
