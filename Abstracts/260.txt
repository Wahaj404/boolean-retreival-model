We describe here the recent results of a multidisciplinary effort to design a biomarker that can actively and continuously decode the progressive changes in neuronal organization leading to epilepsy, a process known as epileptogenesis. Using an animal model of acquired epilepsy, we chronically record hippocampal evoked potentials elicited by an auditory stimulus. Using a set of reduced coordinates, our algorithm can identify universal smooth low-dimensional configurations of the auditory evoked potentials that correspond to distinct stages of epileptogenesis. We use a hidden Markov model to learn the dynamics of the evoked potential, as it evolves along these smooth low-dimensional subsets. We provide experimental evidence that the biomarker is able to exploit subtle changes in the evoked potential to reliably decode the stage of epileptogenesis and predict whether an animal will eventually recover from the injury, or develop spontaneous seizures.
