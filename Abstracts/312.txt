The emerging technology of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) affords a platform and architecture which is dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable, making it ideal for many applications that are high-bandwidth and dynamic in nature. As this technology grows and matures, there is a need for cybersecurity applications to be designed, developed and evaluated. In this paper, we propose a development environment configuration to build security applications targeting the SDN-controller in an effort to explore the technology and the resources available to teach and research the platform from a security application development perspective.
