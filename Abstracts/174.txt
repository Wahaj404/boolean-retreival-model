Activity recognition from wearable sensor data has been researched for many years. Previous works usually extracted features manually, which were hand-designed by the researchers, and then were fed into the classifiers as the inputs. Due to the blindness of manually extracted features, it was hard to choose suitable features for the specific classification task. Besides, this heuristic method for feature extraction could not generalize across different application domains, because different application domains needed to extract different features for classification. There was also work that used auto-encoders to learn features automatically and then fed the features into the K-nearest neighbor classifier. However, these features were learned in an unsupervised manner without using the information of the labels, thus might not be related to the specific classification task. In this paper, we recommend deep neural networks (DNNs) for activity recognition, which can automatically learn suitable features. DNNs overcome the blindness of hand-designed features and make use of the precious label information to improve activity recognition performance. We did experiments on three publicly available datasets for activity recognition and compared deep neural networks with traditional methods, including those that extracted features manually and auto-encoders followed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier. The results showed that deep neural networks could generalize across different application domains and got higher accuracy than traditional methods.
